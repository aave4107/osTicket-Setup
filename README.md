# osTicket-Setup
Following on the Repositorie before this I need to setup the osTicket system with admins employees and end users so I can create a real life scenario that can happen when working a help desk job day to day.

Next I go to the agents tab and click roles then I create a new role called Supreme Admin and allow it to have total control with all the permissions turned on.

In the above picture I created a new department called SysAdmin department so that I can assign agents to this department later.

Then I create a two new agents Jane and John, Jane will be assigned to the SysAdmins department and the role as Supreme Admin.

For John I assign him to a Support Department and role as View Only

After creating the two osTicket Agents I then create an osTicket User to do this I go to the Agent Panel and then click users and then add a user and create Karen who is going to be the enduser who will send the ticket.

Then I am going to create three different SLA's based on the level of problem the ticket is, SLAs stand for Service Level Agreements and are responsible for determing the expected service time response time for that specific issue.

Then on the manage tab I create a couple of common Help Topic Issues that way I can assign it for when a ticket comes in.

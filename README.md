# osTicket-Setup
Following on the Repositorie, before this, I need to set up the osTicket system with admins, employees, and end users so I can create a real-life scenario that can happen when working a help desk job day to day.

Next, I go to the agents tab and click roles, then I create a new role called Supreme Admin and allow it to have total control with all the permissions turned on.

In the above picture, I created a new department called the SysAdmin department so that I can assign agents to this department later.

Then I create two new agents, Jane and John. Jane will be assigned to the SysAdmins department and the role of Supreme Admin.

For John, I assign him to a Support Department and a role as View Only

After creating the two osTicket Agents, I then created an osTicket User. To do this, I go to the Agent Panel and then click Users, and then add a user, and create Karen, who is going to be the end user who will send the ticket.

Then I am going to create three different SLA's based on the level of the problem the ticket is. SLAs stand for Service Level Agreements and are responsible for determining the expected service time and response time for that specific issue.

Then on the manage tab, I create a couple of common Help Topic Issues that I can assign them for when a ticket comes in.
